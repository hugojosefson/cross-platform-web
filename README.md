# Cross Platform Web project setup

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/hugojosefson/cross-platform-web.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

This is an example of a JS web project configured to build and run equally well on Windows, Linux and OSX.

## Prerequisites

The only required step is:

* Install Node.js

## Start the app

```bash
npm start
```

That will automatically:

* install any missing dependencies,
* perform any compilation steps,
* launch the server which serves the app

You can then see the app at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)
